# Singleton | Design Patters | Java | Quickstarts
Catheory: **Creational**

- Ensures that a class has only one instance
- Global access to this instance

## What it resolves
- Two problems are resolved
    - Have a class that has only a single instance
        - Better control access to some shared resources (e.g.: file or a DB)
